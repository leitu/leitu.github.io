##Stash vs GitHub vs Gerrit
I have tried to use Stash here. The repository I used, was a private repoistory. I didn't have any premissions with those repository.

Theoretically, while you are using private repository, the others can't get your code without your approve. But in Stash, it was not, eventhough, you put the repository as private, the others can easily clone and push it...
