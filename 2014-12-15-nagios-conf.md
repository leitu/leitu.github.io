## Nagios

Based on previous page, we try to use dashboard to make the critical more clearly.
We are trying to use few different open source projects, but which easiest way to use is to deploy nagios dash.
We are using http://dingleberry.me/?s=nagios+dash, as the primary one.

```bash
vi /var/www/html/dash/nagios_get.php

#replace nagios3.dat with nagios.dat
```

Then it will be listed automatically.


We also impress with project below
