#Golang for System Administrator

I have been google for many times, I didn't see much script or working methond with golang for pecific system administrator area.

More like it's only available for software engineer, if you go throught the github.com with golang, must likely those thing for system admin using, but not for them to write. 

How it will turn over, or how system administator can use golang for daily operation tasks, I would like to use this way to start this series blog. Hopefully I can make it :)
